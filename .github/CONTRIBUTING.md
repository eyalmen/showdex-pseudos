Thanks for your help in making Showdex better for everyone!

I'm not a stickler for how these should be formatted; just make sure you provide enough info for me to work off of.

If possible, including the following would be **immensely** helpful!

* **Browser** (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, etc.)
* **Showdex Version** (e.g., v1.0.6)
* **Format**, if applicable (e.g., Gen 8 National Dex)

If you would like to be [credited for your contribution](../README.md#contributors), please also include your username on [**Smogon Forums**](https://smogon.com/forums). Otherwise, your **GitHub** username will be used, unless you don't want to be credited.

> **Don't feel like creating a GitHub issue?** No problem!
>
> We're active on our Showdex thread on Smogon Forums. You can also email me directly as well!

## PRs

**Fixed a bug? · Added something cool?**

[![Commitizen friendly](https://img.shields.io/badge/commitizen-friendly-brightgreen.svg)](http://commitizen.github.io/cz-cli)

Not a stickler with these either, but at the very least, please:

* **Fork** this repo & **commit** changes to your fork,
* **Style** your code according to the [**ESLint rules**](../.eslintrc.json),
* **Create** a PR from your fork to this repo, and
* **Provide** a brief description of your changes in your PR.

Although this project makes use of [**Commitizen**](http://commitizen.github.io/cz-cli), you don't need to format your commit messages this way. Use whatever you're comfortable with!

Additionally, I don't make use of any fancy automations like CI (Continuous Integration), so each PR will be manually reviewed. Your patience is greatly appreciated!
